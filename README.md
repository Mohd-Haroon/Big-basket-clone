About Bigbasket:

bigbasket — online grocery store

bigbasket.com is synonymous with superior quality and continues to strive for higher levels of customer trust and confidence, by taking feedback and giving our customers what they want. We have added the convenience of pre-cut fruits in our Fresho range. If it’s a product category you’re looking to shop from, we’ve made it convenient for you to access all products in a section easily. For instance, if you’re looking for beverages, you can order from a long list of beverages that include cool drinks, hot teas, fruit juices and more.

Our Experience Proper communication between team members leads to a hassle-free journey, right from the beginning of the week we all communicated through zoom for clearing doubts and checking each other’s progress till the last minute. Apart from problems like load shading and other technical problems like network issues, we managed to complete the project.
